            PASS was originally created and intended to be an all in one stop for potential employers and employess alike. It was created by Cody Coleman, Kwadwo Nyarko, and Nahom Workie in January 2011, as a passive way to look for and apply to jobs. One of the main foundations of PASS is to enable users to not only customize their resumes and profiles, but also create ways that would enable users to really personalize their job search and allow them to connect with potential employers in much simpler and easier ways.
